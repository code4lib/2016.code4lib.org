                  <p>It is a Code4Lib tradition to welcome those who are new to the conference
                  by organizing dinner groups on the night before the general conference begins.
                  Sign-up is organized by the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/2016_Conference_Committees#Social_Activities">Social Activities Committee</a> on the wiki, and we try to mix a few newcomers with a few veterans
                  who can offer an informal introduction to the conference.  Great for making new friends!
