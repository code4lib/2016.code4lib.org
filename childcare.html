	We are excited to say that Code4Lib will be providing subsidized childcare for those attending the 2016 annual conference in Philadelphia. This service will be provided by The Philadelphia Nanny Network and will be available for all 4 days of the conference, including the pre-conference. This service was made available through generous contributions by our sponsors Equinox and Curate Camp.

	<div class="col-xs-12 childcare-faqs"> 
	 	<strong>How do I register my child for childcare?</strong>
		<p>You will be able to register and pay for childcare when you register for the conference. You may pay for childcare with a different credit card. If you decide to register for childcare after you have already registered for the conference, you may do so by contacting Chad Nelson (chad.nelson at temple dot edu). That latest date to register for childcare is Feb 7th.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-xs-12 childcare-faqs"> 
	 	<strong>What is your cancellation policy?</strong>
		<p>You must give 4 weeks notice to cancel your request. You may cancel by contacting Chad Nelson (chad.nelson at temple dot edu). If you cancel after this time, we cannot refund your money because we will still have to pay the providers for the service.
