              <h2>Welcome to Philadelphia</h2>
              <p>Philadelphia is well known for its important role in US history, but it is also dynamic and modern city, with a
              vibrant art scene, incredible food, and great public transit, as well as hundreds of libraries, museums and universities.
              The New York Times recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/11/travel/52-places-to-go-in-2015.html?_r=0">ranked Philly as the #3</a> place <i>in the world</i> to visit, and we couldn't agree with them more.
              Plus Philly packs it all into a fairly small and compact Center City that is easy to walk around.
              So many of us are a part of the code4lib community &mdash; we're excited to be able to host
              the national code4lib conference!</p>
