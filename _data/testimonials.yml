  blurb: "I keep coming back to Code4lib primarily because of the people I’ve gotten to know. Sure, the presentations are great, but what’s even better is knowing I can grab someone in the hallway, or in IRC, or even an email months later, to ask them about something they’re working on; to get advice and feedback."

  blurb: "Dear Code4Lib, you modeled fallibility all week; fallibility and sharing and kindness and humanity. You brought your code to your life, and your life to your code, and I’m stronger for it, and I hope you are stronger with me. My six-year-old daughter is distressed that I didn’t go to a Valentine’s party yesterday, but really, I think I did."
