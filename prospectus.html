    <p style="margin-top:20px">Code4Lib would love your support to help us run our big annual conference!  Being an autonomous group of professionals with no organizational umbrella,
     we are an experiment in community-driven organizing and the generosity of others.  In addition to moving technology forward in libraries, archives, and museums, the visibility
     you get from sponsoring at Code4Lib can generate sales, spark interest, inspire, and delight our attendees.  If you're ready to make a pledge, or have more questions, get in touch with <a href="mailto:shaune@princeton.edu">Shaun Ellis</a>.</p>

    <h2>Who is Code4Lib?</h2>
    <p>Code4Lib is a core community of

        developers and technologists for libraries,

        museums, and archives who have a strong

        commitment to open technologies.

        Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in

        2003 and held its first face-to-face

        meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first

        official annual conference was held in

        2006 in Corvallis, Oregon. Code4Lib is

        dedicated to being a diverse and inclusive

        community seeking to

        share ideas and build collaboration.</p>

    <h2>About the Code4Lib 2016 Conference</h2>
    <p>The Code4Lib 2016 conference, held at the

        Society Hill Sheraton from March 7-10,

        presents an opportunity for vendors,

        organizations, libraries, and projects to show

        their support for open and collaborative

        solutions for higher education, libraries,

        museums, and archives through attending

        the conference and providing financial

        sponsorship. Each year, the Code4Lib

        conference helps revitalize the community

        as participants meet in person to discuss

        new and ongoing projects in a single-track

        format with 20-minute presentations and

        5-minute lightning talks. Volunteer-led

        pre-conference programs provide in-depth

        participatory learning experiences for

        participants while ad-hoc afternoon

        breakout sessions focus on collaboration

        around specific topics of interest.</p>
